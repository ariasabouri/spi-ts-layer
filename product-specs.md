For the TypeScript part of the ServerProfileInstaller (SPI) project, here’s a specification that will guide us as we move forward, starting with the WebServerHandler for setting up a LAMP stack (PHP 8.3), Redis, and Certbot:

### Product Specifications for TypeScript Part

#### 1. **Client-Server Communication**
   - **SPIClient**: The client will handle secure communication with the Go server, sending commands encrypted with the server's public key and receiving encrypted responses.
     - **Command Encryption**: Commands are encrypted using RSA (public/private key pair).
     - **HTTPS Communication**: All commands will be sent over HTTPS, with an option to allow self-signed certificates for development.
     - **Error Handling**: Network errors, invalid responses, and other issues will be handled with detailed logging.

#### 2. **WebServerHandler**
   - **Purpose**: The WebServerHandler will automate the setup of a LAMP stack with PHP 8.3, Redis, and Certbot for SSL certificates. This handler will handle the installation, configuration, and verification of the setup.
   - **Modules**:
     - **Apache/Nginx Setup**: Automates the installation and configuration of Apache or Nginx.
     - **PHP 8.3 Installation**: Handles installing PHP 8.3 and common modules (like PHP-FPM).
     - **MySQL/MariaDB**: Ensures the installation of MySQL/MariaDB and initial configuration (creating root passwords, securing installations).
     - **Redis**: Automates the installation of Redis and basic configuration (e.g., setting up persistence).
     - **Certbot**: Installs Certbot for managing SSL certificates and automating renewals.

#### 3. **Handlers for Installation and Configuration**
   - **LAMP Stack Setup**:
     - Install Apache/Nginx, PHP 8.3, MySQL/MariaDB.
     - Configure the web server and database with default settings, and allow customization.
   - **Redis Installation**:
     - Install Redis and configure it for persistent storage and systemd.
   - **SSL Setup (Certbot)**:
     - Install Certbot, generate SSL certificates, and set up automatic renewals using cron jobs.

#### 4. **Configuration Files**
   - **config.json**: The configuration will define the setup instructions for different servers, including:
     - Server selection (Apache or Nginx).
     - Database configuration (MySQL or MariaDB).
     - Redis configuration.
     - SSL options (self-signed certificates or Certbot).

#### 5. **Execution Flow**
   - **Step 1**: The user defines their desired server setup in a JSON configuration file.
   - **Step 2**: The TypeScript client sends the relevant setup commands to the Go server.
   - **Step 3**: The Go server executes the commands, providing feedback on the status of each step.
   - **Step 4**: The client receives the output (whether the setup was successful or failed) and logs the output for further review.

### Next Steps

We can start implementing the **WebServerHandler** in TypeScript and define specific functions for installing each component (Apache/Nginx, PHP, Redis, Certbot). Let me know if you want to adjust any part of this specification or if you're ready to move forward with implementation.

For the TypeScript part of the **ServerProfileInstaller (SPI)** project, the project structure can be divided into several logical units to keep the codebase modular, scalable, and easy to maintain. Below is the project structure I suggest, based on your use case and the need for different handlers that automate server setup tasks:

### Project Structure Proposal

│   │   ├── WebServerHandler.ts       # Handles LAMP setup, Redis, Certbot installation

### Logical Units

1. **Handlers** (`/handlers`)
   - **Purpose**: Automate specific setup tasks like installing and configuring web servers, databases, and SSL certificates. Each handler will be responsible for setting up one or more parts of the stack, keeping the logic modular.
   - **WebServerHandler.ts**: The main handler for LAMP stack setup, including PHP 8.3, MySQL/MariaDB, Redis, and Certbot. This can either invoke sub-handlers (e.g., RedisHandler, PHPHandler) or handle everything in one file.
   - **Optional Sub-Handlers**: You can create separate handlers for Redis and PHP if the logic becomes large or specific configurations are needed.

2. **Services** (`/services`)
   - **SPIClient.ts**: Manages the secure communication with the Go server. It will handle sending encrypted commands and receiving encrypted responses. This is the core unit interacting with the Go backend.
   - **CommandService.ts**: Handles command execution logic, including encryption, decryption, error handling, and retries. It interacts with SPIClient to send commands.

3. **Configuration** (`/config`)
   - **config.json**: A customizable JSON file that defines which services (LAMP stack, Redis, SSL) should be set up on the target server. You could specify things like whether to use Apache or Nginx, MySQL or MariaDB, etc.

4. **Utilities** (`/utils`)
   - **Logger.ts**: A utility class to handle all logging (both for CLI and file output). It can also manage verbosity levels (e.g., debug, info, error).
   - **EncryptionUtils.ts**: A utility to encapsulate the encryption/decryption logic using RSA. This will help reduce duplication across the codebase where encryption is needed (e.g., encrypting commands, decrypting responses).

5. **Main Entry Point** (`index.ts`)
   - **index.ts**: The entry point of the TypeScript application, responsible for loading configuration (e.g., reading `config.json`), initializing services (like the `SPIClient`), and invoking the `WebServerHandler` to begin the server setup process.

6. **Certificates** (`/certs`)
   - **public_key.pem/private_key.pem**: This directory will store the RSA keys needed for secure communication. These will either be generated locally or provided by the Go server during an initial handshake.

7. **Logging** (`/logs`)
   - **execution.log**: Stores all relevant execution information, including command outputs, errors, and debugging details. The logging should be separate from verbose UI output to keep the interface clean.

### Suggested Execution Flow

1. **Initialization**:
   - The main `index.ts` will load `config.json` to read the server setup instructions.
   - The `SPIClient` will be initialized with the required encryption keys (public/private).
   
2. **Handler Invocation**:
   - Based on the configuration, the `WebServerHandler` will be invoked to begin setting up the LAMP stack, Redis, and Certbot.
   
3. **Command Execution**:
   - The `SPIClient` will send encrypted commands to the Go server to install and configure software (e.g., `apt-get install apache2`, `apt-get install redis`).
   
4. **Feedback**:
   - The Go server will return the output (encrypted), which will be decrypted and processed by the client.
   - Logs will be written to `execution.log` to track the progress of the installation.

### Advantages of This Structure

- **Modularity**: Each handler is responsible for a specific task, which makes the code easy to extend and maintain.
- **Security**: All sensitive communication with the Go server will be encrypted using RSA, ensuring secure automation.
- **Scalability**: Additional handlers can be added as needed (e.g., for future setups like Node.js, Docker, etc.).
- **Configurability**: The setup instructions can easily be customized by modifying `config.json`, without changing the core code.

Does this structure meet your expectations? Let me know if you'd like any changes or further elaboration!
